## Project objective
Melbourne was voted world's most liveable city for 6 consecutive years between 2012 and 2017 for its high quality of life. The city centre, more commonly known as the Central Business District (CBD) takes the shape of a one-mile by half-a-mile core grid that is home to most of the city's businesses. Since 2010, the city has rolled out sensors that counts hourly pedestrian traffic at various strategic locations all over the CBD.
<p>
The city has made data from the sensors publically available and is updated on an hourly basis. While analysis can readily be done on historical data, there has not been much work on developing forecasting models to predict future pedestrian traffic in the city. This project is aimed to addressed this gap into order to support various stakeholders, including the local government authority, Victoria State Police and business owners.

## Methodology
Data from individual sensors was gathered via <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/b2ak-trbp"> City of Melbourne Open Data API</a> interface.
